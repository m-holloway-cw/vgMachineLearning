A representation of my capstone project for my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.


The program runs a Node.js Express server that

*utilized Python and its machine learning libraries to intake data about historical video game sales

*analyze the trends and outliers in the data

*provide explorable visuals in a dashboard

*create a tool to help predict sales figures(using a linear regression model) given inputs of game genre, release platform, and target year.
